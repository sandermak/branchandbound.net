# Sander Mak
Sander is a Fellow at Luminis in The Netherlands, where he crafts modular and scalable software, most often on the JVM, but with a touch of TypeScript when needed. He also is a Java Champion and author of the O'Reilly book 'Java 9 Modularity' (see [javamodularity.com](https://javamodularity)). As an avid conference speaker, Sander loves sharing knowledge, also through his blog at [branchandbound.net](http://branchandbound.net) and as [Pluralsight](http://bit.ly/sander-ps) instructor.
